Sample Salad

Project Scope:
This project aims to provide a cheap and accessible music production centre (MPC) controller. 
The solution will address the high-cost entry point of these devices, targeting the niche market of entry-level producers who lack the funds to buy such equipment. 
The design will mimic the form and function of the Akai MPC.
